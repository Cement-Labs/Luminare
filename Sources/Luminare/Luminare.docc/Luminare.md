# ``Luminare``

``Luminare`` is an [open source](https://github.com/MrKai77/Luminare) SwiftUI framework designed to enhance the development of macOS applications by providing **a collection of pre-styled components** that adhere to a consistent design language.
It simplifies the creation of visually appealing and functional user interfaces.

## Features

- **Adopts a declarative syntax** that is consistent with SwiftUI.
- **Emphasizes modularity and reusability**, allowing developers to create custom interfaces with minimal boilerplate code.
- Uses a combination of system-defined and custom modifiers to apply **consistent styling** across different components.
