# ``Luminare/LuminareCompactPicker``

@Row {
    @Column {
        This picker works like the SwiftUI `Picker` that accepts any elements as content with a selection binding.
        
        It can be styled either as a menu or as segmented controls depending on the ``LuminareCompactPickerStyle``.
    }
    
    @Column {
        ![LuminareCompactPicker](LuminareCompactPicker)
    }
}

@Row {
    @Column(size: 3) {
        ```swift
        LuminareCompactPicker(selection: $selection, style: .menu) {
            ForEach(data, id: \.keyPath) { element in
                // content
            }
        }
        ```
    }
    
    @Column(size: 2) {
        Since a native SwiftUI `Picker` is wrapped inside a menu styled ``LuminareCompactPicker``, it's free to use any contents that are valid in a SwiftUI `Picker`.
    }
}

@Row {
    @Column(size: 2) {
        ```swift
        LuminareCompactPicker(selection: $selection, style: .segmented) {
            ForEach(data, id: \.self) { element in
                Group {
                    // content
                }
                .id(element)
            }
        }
        ```
    }
    
    @Column(size: 3) {
        However, when using a segment styled ``LuminareCompactPicker``, it's worth mentioning that the `id` of each element needs to be `self`, in order to expose the inner value to the picker.
        
        In most cases, it can be done using `id: \.self` key path in a `ForEach`.
        However, it's safer to manually bind each inner value to its content using the `id()` modifier.
