# ``Luminare/LuminareWindow``


A ``LuminareWindow`` holds a ``LuminareView`` that wraps the window content. It's free to decide how your design looks by toggling the content view passed to the initializer. It has traffic lights but no title bars.

Typically, you are likely to put a ``LuminareDividedStack`` inside, resulting in a vertically divided layout:

![`LuminareWindow`](LuminareWindow)
